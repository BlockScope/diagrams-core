* 0.5: 9 March 2012

  * New features:

    - New 'Juxtaposable' class

    - New NullBackend and D types, for conveniently giving a
      monomorphic type to diagrams when we don't care which one it is.

    - #27: Change type of adjustDia to return a new options record
      (with an explicitly filled-in size)

  * New instances:
    - Enveloped, HasOrigin, Juxtaposable, HasStyle, and Transformable
      instances for Sets and tuples
    - V Double = Double
    - Juxtaposable and Boundable instances for Map

  * API changes

    - AnnDiagram -> QDiagram

    - #61: terminology change from "bounds" to "envelope"
      + boundary -> envelopeP
      + "bounding region" -> "envelope"
      + Bounds -> Envelope
      + Boundable -> Enveloped
      + getBounds -> getEnvelope
      + etc.

    - Split out definition of Point into separate package
      (vector-space-points)

    - The Point constructor P is no longer exported from
      Graphics.Rendering.Diagrams.  See the Diagrams.TwoD.Types module
      from diagrams-lib for new tools for working with abstract 2D
      points.  If you really need the P constructor, import
      Graphics.Rendering.Diagrams.Points.

    - Name-related functions now return "located bounding functions"
      instead of pairs of points and bounds, to allow for future
      expansion.

  * Dependency/version changes:
    - vector-space 0.8 is now required.
    - Bump base upper bound to allow 4.5; now tested with GHC 7.4.1.

  * Bug fixes:
    - Bug fix related to empty envelopes

0.4: 23 October 2011
  * improved documentation
  * a few new instances (Newtype Point, Boundable Point)
  * new functions (value, clearValue, resetValue) for working with
    alternate query monoids0.1: 17 May 2011
  * initial preview release

0.3: 18 June 2011
  * big overhaul of name maps:
    - allow arbitrary types as atomic names
    - carry along bounding functions as well as names in NameMaps
    - additional functions for querying information associated with names
  * fix for issue #34 (fix behavior of setBounds)
  * Transformable and HasOrigin instances for Transformations

0.2: 3 June 2011
  * bounding regions can now be overridden
  * new namePoint function for more flexibly assigning names to arbitrary points
  * add HasStyle, Boundable, and HasOrigin instances for lists
  * add a "trivial backend"
  * transformable attributes

0.1.1: 18 May 2011
  * link to new website
